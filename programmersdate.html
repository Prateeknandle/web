If you are the Ross to a Rachel,<br>
sharing the iconicness of SpongeBob and Patrick,<br>
adventuring hand in hand like Sherlock and Watson<br>
and partnering like Veeres, SITE and SSE in association with TECHOTSAV'21 bring 'Programmer's DATE' for unlocking yet another achievement with your other half.<br>
This compatibility check trespasses the limits of mind reading, guessworks and mutual understanding by raising the bar to consistent coding dually.<br>
It is an ultimate coding challenge where two team members will be seated in different rooms and given separate coding questions. The members will switch PCs after regular intervals and continue with the other person's code. No communication between the members is allowed during the competition.<br>
Both the members will be coding on different platforms. One person will code on Beatest and the other on Hackerrank. It is not only switching of codes, but platforms as well.<br>
Also, Extra points will be provided if they answer some questions about each other correctly during the event. So make sure you know your partner well!<br>
Don't go by the name..... All boys and all girls team is also welcome.<br></h3>
